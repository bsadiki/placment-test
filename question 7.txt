a- calcuate perimetre of triangle or circle
b- same as a-
c- 5
d- Figure : an abstract class that represent a figure (could be a circle or triangle)
	Circle : a class that allows to calculate perimetre of circle (has one attribute radius)
	Trinagle : a class that allows to calculate perimetre of triangle (has three attributes that are components of triangle )
e- procedural is easier because it has one simple class and not has not a complicated design
f- it would be difficult to add a new shape (we will have to reopen the code after production)
